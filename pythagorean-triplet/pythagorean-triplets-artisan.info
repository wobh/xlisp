primitive-triplets (Function)
=============================

Syntax:
.......

 -- Function: primitive-triplets n -> result-list

Arguments and Values:
.....................

N--a non-negative integer multiple of 4 (see explanantion below).

RESULT-LIST--a sorted list of sorted lists.

Description:
............

`primitive-triplets' returns a LIST of all primitive Pythagorean
triplets having N as a component. The components other than the
argument can be quite large.

A primitive Pythagorean triplet has its 3 components coprime. So,
{3,4,5} a primitive Pythagorean triplet since 3,4 and 5 don't have a
common factor.  On the other hand, {6,8,10}, although a Pythagorean
triplet, is not primitive since 2 divides all three components.

A method for finding all primitive Pythagorean triplet is given in
Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple#Generating_a_triple

The triplet a=(m^2-n^2), b=2*m*n and c=(m^2+n^2), where m and n are
coprime and m-n>0 is odd, generate a primitive triplet. Note that this
implies that b has to be divisible by 4 and a and c are odd. Also note
that we may have either a>b or b>a.

The function `primitive-triplets' should then use the formula above
with b set to its argument and find all possible pairs {m,n} such that
m>n, m-n is odd, b=2*m*n and m and n are coprime.

Exceptional Situations:
.......................

Might signal an error of type `type-error' if any arguments are not an
non-negative integer.

Might also signal `arithmetic-error'.


triplets-in-range (Function)
============================

Syntax:
.......

 -- Function: triplets-in-range min max -> result-list

Arguments and Values:
.....................

MIN, MAX--non-negative integers.

RESULT-LIST--a sorted list of sorted lists.

Description:
............

`triplets-in-range' returns a LIST of all Pythagorean triplets {a,b,c}
with MIN <= a,b,c <= MAX.

Exceptional Situations:
.......................

Might signal an error of type `type-error' if any arguments are not an
non-negative integer.

Might also signal `arithmetic-error'.


pythagorean-p (Function)
========================

Syntax:
.......

 -- Function: pythagorean-p sequence -> generalized boolean

Arguments and Values:
.....................

SEQUENCE--a proper sequence.

GENERALIZED-BOOLEAN--a generalized boolean.
